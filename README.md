# F That Noise

The goal of F That Noise is to empower people to take action to effect positive change. When faced with large-scale policy changes or adversity, people may feel like they are powerless and don't know what actions they can take to make a difference. This app allows anyone to post an action or event under various categories so that other people can view it and join their cause. In particular, I built the MVP over the weekend following Trump's first week in office.

The best way to get acquainted with what is already here is to download it, seed the database (seeds file already populated), and play around with it. Anyone who would like to add additional features is welcome to do so. I only ask for communication so we all can coordinate. Here are my  thoughts for what is most important to do next, but I am open to other suggestions:

(Roughly ordered by importance):

* Finish styling other app pages (should be easy if re-using existing CSS)
* Improve search functionality for actions and events
* Guest buttons to follow when someone is not logged in
* E-mail password activation and reset
* Page to create categories and add admins for admins
* Upload images for events and suggestions
* Pagination
* Build out user profiles
* Better formatted errors
* Add flash notices (like contact has been submitted)

Please let me know if you are interested, let's put something awesome together :)
