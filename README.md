# README

The goal of this web app is to empower people to take action to effect positive change. When faced with large-scale policy changes or adversity, people may feel like they are powerless and don't know what actions they can take to make a difference. This app allows anyone to post an action or event under various categories so that other people can view it and join their cause. In particular, I built the MVP over the weekend following Trump's first week in office.

The best way to get acquainted with what is already here is to download it, seed the database (seeds file already populated), and play around with it. Anyone who would like to add additional features is welcome to do so. I only ask for communication so we all can coordinate. Here are my  thoughts for what is most important to do next, but I am open to other suggestions:

(Roughly ordered by importance):

Add search functionality for actions and events

Improve location tracking to make it easier for people to find events near them


A few minor but important tweaks (users index page for admins, e-mail password reset)

Build upon the currently only accept/deny options for ideas to allow things like ignore

Front end real time filtering of ideas based on various criteria

Ability to share on other social media

Improve styling and add JavaScript to front end (for example, buttons)

Upload images to idea show pages

Build out user profiles

Others?

Please let me know if you are interested, let's put something awesome together :)
